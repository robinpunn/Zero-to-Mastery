If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
    BFS
    It starts search the closest nodes to the parent first
*/

/*
If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
    BFS if memory isn't an issue
    DFS would take a very long time
    BFS would be memory intensive

/*
If the tree is very wide:
    DFS
    BFS would need too much memory

If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:

Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
